Things to improve on:

Navigation Bar
- darken the font color for the inactive tabs

Home Page
- Have a shadow effect for the text to avoid blending in to the BG

Gallery
- Make the image interactive via Zooming In and Closing

To-Do
- Items on High Priority should be placed at the front
- Find a way to edit without having to select the item first
- Change the Combobox and Edit Button design

Notes
- Just display the title since the box is small
- Same issue with the editing
- Have a prompt before deleting a note

Link
- Better if boxed per element so it would look neat in the eyes
- Find a way to make the links functional
